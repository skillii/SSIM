* library of linear ic definitions

* this is a reduced version of microsim's linear subcircuit library.
* you are welcome to make as many copies of it as you find convenient.
*
* the parameters in the opamp library were derived from the data sheets for
* each part.  the macromodel used is similar to the one described in:
*
*	macromodeling of integrated circuit operational amplifiers
*	  by graeme boyle, barry cohn, donald pederson, and james solomon
*	ieee journal of solie-state circuits, vol. sc-9, no. 6,	dec. 1974
*
* differences from the reference (above) occur in the output limiting stage
* which was modified to reduce internally generated currents associated with
* output voltage limiting, as well as short-circuit current limiting.
*
* the opamps are modelled at room temperature and do not track changes with
* temperature.  this library file contains models for nominal, not worst case,
* devices.
